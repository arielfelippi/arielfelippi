### Hi there 👋

About me :scream:

My name is Ariel Felippi from Brazil (🇧🇷). I've been working as a Web Developer since 2015 and currently I'm an instructor in the Web Developer course at Infoserv school.

In my free time I like to play (and watch) poker (♦️♠️♥️♣️), to watch formula 1 (🏎️), to watch movies (🎞️) and series (📺), to read books (📚), to listen to music (🎵) and drink beer (🍺).


Would you like to find me?
